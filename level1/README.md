# Level 1: Basic Problems in C++

In this directory, I will solve basic problems using C++ to learn new concepts in the language. I already have a strong understanding of C, having solved many problems (easy, medium, and hard) in it. After this, I plan to start learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, which is the main reason I began learning C++ in the first place
