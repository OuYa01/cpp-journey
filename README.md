# cpp-journey
A personal repository documenting my journey of learning C++ from scratch. This repo contains practice exercises, projects, and notes as I progress through a C++ course, focusing on mastering the fundamentals and exploring advanced concepts.

## What is c++ ?
C++ is a **general-purpose programming language** developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1983. It is an extension of the **C language** with added features such as **object-oriented programming**, **templates**, **exception handling**, and more. C++ is widely used in software development for applications that require high performance and precise control over system resources.

### Key Features:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Performance**: Compiled language offering fast execution and efficient memory management.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides reusable components for data structures and algorithms.
- **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility with minimal code changes.
