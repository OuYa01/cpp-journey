# cpp-journey
Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This repo documents my progress as I learn C++ by solving problems and building projects. It is organized into levels, with each level representing a step forward in my understanding of C++.


## Structure
- **`level1/`**: Basic C++ problems (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).
- **`level2/`**: Intermediate C++ problems (e.g., arrays, algorithms).
- **`projects/`**: Practical projects built using skills from each level.


## How to Navigate
1. Check out the `README.md` in each folder for details about its contents.
2. Problems are organized by level, and projects are tied to the skills learned in those levels.

## What is c++ ?
C++ is a **general-purpose programming language** developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1983. It is an extension of the **C language** with added features such as **object-oriented programming**, **templates**, **exception handling**, and more. C++ is widely used in software development for applications that require high performance and precise control over system resources.

### Key Features:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Performance**: Compiled language offering fast execution and efficient memory management.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides reusable components for data structures and algorithms.
- **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility with minimal code changes.
